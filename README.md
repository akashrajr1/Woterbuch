A chrome extension for German-English & English-German translations
APIs from [Yandex](https://yandex.com/)

### Motivation

I recently started learning German on the side, and I couldn't find a chrome extension which solved my needs for German Translations. So, I decided to build my own ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### Deployment Instructions


* Get a API key from [Yandex Dev](https://yandex.com/dev/keys/) and `export YANDEX_DICTIONARY_API_KEY=XXXXX`
```
npm install
npm run build
npm run install-tools
npm run server
```
* Go to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/) and switch on Developer Mode if not done already
* Click `Load Unpacked` and load `/src/client`
* Shortcuts are `Cmd+D` or `Ctrl+D`

### Development Instructions

* Use `.js` files from webpack `/src/client/dist`
